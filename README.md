# DSP---Voice-Based-COVID-19-Screener

Based on several voice parameters, a person's voice could be used to predict whether the person may be carrying the virus.

Considering frequency, amplitude variations the person's voice parameters would be compared to screen the individual.

A supervised learning algorithm will also be implemented to determine as to whether the person may be carrying the virus, for a more concrete conclusion.
